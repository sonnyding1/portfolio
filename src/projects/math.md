Under construction...

My interactive math web app has the following features:

- Generates math exercises (addition, multiplication, factorization) with difficulty selectors
- Experience and level system
- Account system so users can retain their levels

## Tech stack

This project is a fullstack project, relying mainly on Next.js.
